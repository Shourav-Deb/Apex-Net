# 🎓 Apex net - Apex University Multi-Campus Network

> 🧠 A full-scale simulated network infrastructure for a real-world university using Cisco Packet Tracer.



## 📌 Project Overview

This project designs and configures a scalable network for **Apex University**, connecting **5 campuses** and a **central server room** using routers, switches, serial links, DHCP, DNS, and OSPF routing.

Built entirely in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, this topology simulates a real-world educational network with dynamic routing, centralized services, and wireless/wired LANs.
